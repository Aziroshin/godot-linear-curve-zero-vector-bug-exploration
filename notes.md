The 8. baked point in the curve gets a default basis and produces the first zero vector error.

Perhaps solution: When spline linear, calculate tangent based on bezier curve function with dimension n-1

How to find out that the spline is n-1?
    Or: How to find out that control1 and 2 are on the same line as point 1 and two?
